# Discogs-Wantlist-Importer
Python script to import Discogs Wantlists from a delimitered file (like the Discogs Wantlist exported file)

I wrote this script to take an exported Discogs Wantlist file (edited it) and the import (adds releases) into a different user's Wantlist

Needs Python 3.x installed
Need to install Discogs API Client (in a terminal use 'pip3 install discogs_client')

How to run:
1. Export a Discogs user's wantlist (https://www.discogs.com/users/export) as a '.csv' file.
2. Edit the file to remove / add releases. Lines must be of the below format - text delimited by ','. 
   The artist should be the second field, the title should be the third field and the release id should be the eighth field:

      Catalog#,Artist,Title,Label,Format,Rating,Released,release_id,Notes (delimited by ',')  

   Only Artist and Title and release_id will be used, if they are present.

3. Get a token for the NEW user from 'www.discogs.com/settings/developers'
4. Run the script (in a terminal) in the same directory as the modified / exported '.csv' file with the command 'python3 ImportDiscogsWantlist.py'
5. Answer the questions, and the script will add the releases to the NEW user's Wantlist.
6. Any errors (unwritten releases) can be found in the output file 'ImportDiscogsWantlist_output.txt'
